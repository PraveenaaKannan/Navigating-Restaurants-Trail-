In todayâ€™s data-driven world, Business Intelligence (BI) plays a crucial role in helping businesses make informed decisions. In the restaurant industry, BI can be used to analyze customer preferences, track sales trends, and optimize daily operations. This project focuses on building a comprehensive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics to visualize key metrics from restaurant data. The dashboard includes insights on total sales, best and least-selling dishes, customer demographics, peak hours, payment methods, and employee performance. By leveraging the visual and analytical capabilities of IBM Cognos, the dashboard enables restaurant managers to transform raw data into meaningful insights, leading to improved efficiency, targeted marketing, and better customer service.
